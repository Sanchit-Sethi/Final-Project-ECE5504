# Final-Project-ECE5504
Final project for Computer Architecture

This is a custom RoCC accelerator that operates on UC Berkley risc-v chipyard SOC. 
The instruction that is accelerated is a vector multiplication and addition for AI, DSP based application.

This repo served as an inspiration to build our code for the custom RoCC accelerator
